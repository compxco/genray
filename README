Aug. 19, 2013
=============
Adjusted makefile_mpi.gfortran64.bob9.CentOS for mpich2.
On bob9 installation, with mpich2, version 2.1, had to start
the mpd demon, then run with mppiexec:
mpd &   This starts a deamon, which handles the some security issues.
mpiexec -np 4

Sept. 11, 2013
==============
Removed the cntrl-M line endings from about 20 .f and .i files, which
come in when Yuri editted from mpi with windows.

Updated read_write_genray_input_prep.f from read_write_genray_input.f.
Will need to add
     common/mpimyrank/myrank !In serial run: myrank=0; In MPI run: myrank=rank
     data myrank/0/  !In serial run: myrank=0; In MPI run: myrank=rank
when invoking read_write_genray_input_prep.f from prepare_genray_input.f90.
This will be serial code, so set myrank=0 as default.

Added
delim='apostrophe',
in several open() of namelist files, to ensure that
any namelist writes include apostrophe delimiters in
the character variables.
This also solves a problem with long namelist character
variables when writing and reading namelists using the
INTEL and PGI compilers.


July 16, 2014
=============
Added momentum conservation in the Lin-Liu subroutine
c[175] (lin-liu_curnt.f), controlled by new namelist variable 
c[175] ieffic_mom_cons (which works with ieffic=4).  Same as
done in TORBEAM, per Marushchenko et al, PoP 18, 032501 (2011).


Mar 1, 2017
===========
This version, "genray_v10.10_170301", from CompX2 trunk/.
Ran the 00_Genray_Regression_Tests test suite (15 tests).
All looked OK.


Jul 25, 2017
============
version="genray_v10.11_170725"
Adjustment of ioxm procedure for picking roots of the cold
plasma dispersion.   Also, adjustment of meaning of ib namelist.
See a_change.i.
NOTE:   ioxm_n_par was previously introduced as an alternative to ioxm,
        to help resolve ambiguity in the effects of ioxm.


Apr 10, 2018
============
Put in to git version control on CompX2.
========================================
version="genray_v10.11_180410"  
Otherwise, little changed from "genray_v10.11_170725".

June 10, 2019
=============
Got connection to git@github.com:compxco/genray.git working,
using ssh method for connection to github.com.

200117
======
Updating locate local git/genray/ and also
github.com/compxco/genray with this version.
version="genray_v10.13_200117"
Changes from earlier versions are listed in a_change.i.
Make files and instructions for compiling genray and pgplot
are included.  GENRAY has also been compiled with the
gnu environment at cori.nersc.gov, and results compared
closely with results obtained in the intel compiler environment.



200913
======
Genray version="genray_v10.14_200831".
Several new features are added, as documented in a_change.i.
Also, introduced the file genray_help to document the namelist variables
used in the code.  Previously, this has been done with various
"template" files, genray.dat_template_* and genray.in_template_* 
applicable for  mixed unit input specs and MKSA input specs, respectively.
These have been combined into the one file, genray_help, which will
subsequently be maintained as the namelist variable explanations file.
Updating github.com/compxco/genray. 

210214
======
Commit message:
Genray version="genray_v11.0_210212".
Several refinements to improve root finding.
Adjusted logic in searching for the proper root in function hotnp 
(used for id=6), which sometimes was finding a wrong root of the
dispersion in near vacuum (when two cold roots are very close).
See a_change.i.

git add -u [stages changed files that are tracked]


240110
======
Interesting talks (hosted by Bonoli) by Batchelor on RAYS code, 
and by Mark Cianciosa (ORNL)
on a new ray tracing code constructed with the graph framework:
https://code.ornl.gov/m4c/graph_framework
Supports auto differentiation.  Showed 100,000 EC rays into a eqdsk tokamak
representation, obtained with 1 min of Perlmutter GPU wall-clock time.

======
