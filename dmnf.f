C  ***  PURPOSE  ***
C
C        THIS ROUTINE INTERACTS WITH SUBROUTINE  DRMNF  IN AN ATTEMPT
C     TO FIND AN N-VECTOR  X*  THAT MINIMIZES THE (UNCONSTRAINED)
C     OBJECTIVE FUNCTION COMPUTED BY  CALCF.  (OFTEN THE  X*  FOUND IS
C     A LOCAL MINIMIZER RATHER THAN A GLOBAL ONE.)
C
C  ***  PARAMETERS  ***
C
C        THE PARAMETERS FOR  DMNF ARE THE SAME AS THOSE FOR  DMNG
C     (WHICH SEE), EXCEPT THAT CALCG IS OMITTED.  INSTEAD OF CALLING
C     CALCG TO OBTAIN THE GRADIENT OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION AT X,
C      DMNF CALLS DS7GRD, WHICH COMPUTES AN APPROXIMATION TO THE
C     GRADIENT BY FINITE (FORWARD AND CENTRAL) DIFFERENCES USING THE
C     METHOD OF REF. 1.  THE FOLLOWING INPUT COMPONENT IS OF INTEREST
C     IN THIS REGARD (AND IS NOT DESCRIBED IN  DMNG).
C
C V(ETA0)..... V(42) IS AN ESTIMATED BOUND ON THE RELATIVE ERROR IN THE
C             OBJECTIVE FUNCTION VALUE COMPUTED BY CALCF...
C                  (TRUE VALUE) = (COMPUTED VALUE) * (1 + E),
C             WHERE ABS(E) .LE. V(ETA0).  DEFAULT = MACHEP * 10**3,
C             WHERE MACHEP IS THE UNIT ROUNDOFF.
C
C        THE OUTPUT VALUES IV(NFCALL) AND IV(NGCALL) HAVE DIFFERENT
C     MEANINGS FOR  DMNF THAN FOR  DMNG...
C
C IV(NFCALL)... IV(6) IS THE NUMBER OF CALLS SO FAR MADE ON CALCF (I.E.,
C             FUNCTION EVALUATIONS) EXCLUDING THOSE MADE ONLY FOR
C             COMPUTING GRADIENTS.  THE INPUT VALUE IV(MXFCAL) IS A
C             LIMIT ON IV(NFCALL).
C IV(NGCALL)... IV(30) IS THE NUMBER OF FUNCTION EVALUATIONS MADE ONLY
C             FOR COMPUTING GRADIENTS.  THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FUNCTION
C             EVALUATIONS IS THUS  IV(NFCALL) + IV(NGCALL).

C
C  ***  ALGORITHM NOTES  ***
C
C        LET  G  AND  H  BE THE CURRENT GRADIENT AND HESSIAN APPROXIMA-
C     TION RESPECTIVELY AND LET D BE THE CURRENT SCALE VECTOR.  THIS
C     ROUTINE ASSUMES DIG = DIAG(D)**-2 * G  AND  NWTSTP = H**-1 * G.
C     THE STEP COMPUTED IS THE SAME ONE WOULD GET BY REPLACING G AND H
C     BY  DIAG(D)**-1 * G  AND  DIAG(D)**-1 * H * DIAG(D)**-1,
C     COMPUTING STEP, AND TRANSLATING STEP BACK TO THE ORIGINAL
C     VARIABLES, I.E., PREMULTIPLYING IT BY DIAG(D)**-1.

C
C  ***  APPLICATION AND USAGE RESTRICTIONS  ***
C
C        THIS ROUTINE UPDATES THE CHOLESKY FACTOR  L  OF A SYMMETRIC
C     POSITIVE DEFINITE MATRIX TO WHICH A SECANT UPDATE IS BEING
C     APPLIED -- IT COMPUTES A CHOLESKY FACTOR  LPLUS  OF
C     L * (I + Z*W**T) * (I + W*Z**T) * L**T.  IT IS ASSUMED THAT  W
C     AND  Z  HAVE BEEN CHOSEN SO THAT THE UPDATED MATRIX IS STRICTLY
C     POSITIVE DEFINITE.
C
C  ***  ALGORITHM NOTES  ***
C
C        THIS CODE USES RECURRENCE 3 OF REF. 1 (WITH D(J) = 1 FOR ALL J)
C     TO COMPUTE  LPLUS  OF THE FORM  L * (I + Z*W**T) * Q,  WHERE  Q
C     IS AN ORTHOGONAL MATRIX THAT MAKES THE RESULT LOWER TRIANGULAR.
C        LPLUS MAY HAVE SOME NEGATIVE DIAGONAL ELEMENTS.

C     TO FIND AN N-VECTOR  X*  THAT MINIMIZES THE (UNCONSTRAINED)
C     OBJECTIVE FUNCTION  FX = F(X)  COMPUTED BY THE CALLER.  (OFTEN
C     THE  X*  FOUND IS A LOCAL MINIMIZER RATHER THAN A GLOBAL ONE.)
C
C  ***  PARAMETERS  ***
C
C        THE PARAMETERS FOR DRMNF ARE THE SAME AS THOSE FOR  DMNG
C     (WHICH SEE), EXCEPT THAT CALCF, CALCG, UIPARM, URPARM, AND UFPARM
C     ARE OMITTED, AND A PARAMETER  FX  FOR THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
C     VALUE AT X IS ADDED.  INSTEAD OF CALLING CALCG TO OBTAIN THE
C     GRADIENT OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION AT X, DRMNF CALLS DS7GRD,
C     WHICH COMPUTES AN APPROXIMATION TO THE GRADIENT BY FINITE
C     (FORWARD AND CENTRAL) DIFFERENCES USING THE METHOD OF REF. 1.
C     THE FOLLOWING INPUT COMPONENT IS OF INTEREST IN THIS REGARD
C     (AND IS NOT DESCRIBED IN  DMNG).
C
C V(ETA0)..... V(42) IS AN ESTIMATED BOUND ON THE RELATIVE ERROR IN THE
C             OBJECTIVE FUNCTION VALUE COMPUTED BY CALCF...
C                  (TRUE VALUE) = (COMPUTED VALUE) * (1 + E),
C             WHERE ABS(E) .LE. V(ETA0).  DEFAULT = MACHEP * 10**3,
C             WHERE MACHEP IS THE UNIT ROUNDOFF.
C
C        THE OUTPUT VALUES IV(NFCALL) AND IV(NGCALL) HAVE DIFFERENT
C     MEANINGS FOR  DMNF THAN FOR  DMNG...
C
C IV(NFCALL)... IV(6) IS THE NUMBER OF CALLS SO FAR MADE ON CALCF (I.E.,
C             FUNCTION EVALUATIONS) EXCLUDING THOSE MADE ONLY FOR
C             COMPUTING GRADIENTS.  THE INPUT VALUE IV(MXFCAL) IS A
C             LIMIT ON IV(NFCALL).
C IV(NGCALL)... IV(30) IS THE NUMBER OF FUNCTION EVALUATIONS MADE ONLY
C             FOR COMPUTING GRADIENTS.  THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FUNCTION
C             EVALUATIONS IS THUS  IV(NFCALL) + IV(NGCALL).

C     OUTPUT VALUE FROM  DMNG (AND  DMNF), IS NOT REFERENCED BY
C     DRMNG OR THE SUBROUTINES IT CALLS.
C        FX AND G NEED NOT HAVE BEEN INITIALIZED WHEN DRMNG IS CALLED
C     WITH IV(1) = 12, 13, OR 14.
C
C IV(1) = 1 MEANS THE CALLER SHOULD SET FX TO F(X), THE FUNCTION VALUE
C             AT X, AND CALL DRMNG AGAIN, HAVING CHANGED NONE OF THE
C             OTHER PARAMETERS.  AN EXCEPTION OCCURS IF F(X) CANNOT BE
C             (E.G. IF OVERFLOW WOULD OCCUR), WHICH MAY HAPPEN BECAUSE
C             OF AN OVERSIZED STEP.  IN THIS CASE THE CALLER SHOULD SET
C             IV(TOOBIG) = IV(2) TO 1, WHICH WILL CAUSE DRMNG TO IG-
C             NORE FX AND TRY A SMALLER STEP.  THE PARAMETER NF THAT
C              DMNG PASSES TO CALCF (FOR POSSIBLE USE BY CALCG) IS A
C             COPY OF IV(NFCALL) = IV(6).
C IV(1) = 2 MEANS THE CALLER SHOULD SET G TO G(X), THE GRADIENT VECTOR
C             OF F AT X, AND CALL DRMNG AGAIN, HAVING CHANGED NONE OF
C             THE OTHER PARAMETERS EXCEPT POSSIBLY THE SCALE VECTOR D
C             WHEN IV(DTYPE) = 0.  THE PARAMETER NF THAT  DMNG PASSES
C             TO CALCG IS IV(NFGCAL) = IV(7).  IF G(X) CANNOT BE
C             EVALUATED, THEN THE CALLER MAY SET IV(TOOBIG) TO 0, IN
C             WHICH CASE DRMNG WILL RETURN WITH IV(1) = 65.

c$$$C***PURPOSE  Returns double precision machine dependent constants
c$$$C***DESCRIPTION
c$$$C
c$$$C     This is the CMLIB version of D1MACH, the double precision machine
c$$$C     constants subroutine originally developed for the PORT library.
c$$$C
c$$$C     D1MACH can be used to obtain machine-dependent parameters
c$$$C     for the local machine environment.  It is a function
c$$$C     subprogram with one (input) argument, and can be called
c$$$C     as follows, for example
c$$$C
c$$$C          D = D1MACH(I)
c$$$C
c$$$C     where I=1,...,5.  The (output) value of D above is
c$$$C     determined by the (input) value of I.  The results for
c$$$C     various values of I are discussed below.
c$$$C
c$$$C  Double-precision machine constants
c$$$C  D1MACH( 1) = B**(EMIN-1), the smallest positive magnitude.
c$$$C  D1MACH( 2) = B**EMAX*(1 - B**(-T)), the largest magnitude.
c$$$C  D1MACH( 3) = B**(-T), the smallest relative spacing.
c$$$C  D1MACH( 4) = B**(1-T), the largest relative spacing.
c$$$C  D1MACH( 5) = LOG10(B)

!***DESCRIPTION
!
!   D1MACH can be used to obtain machine-dependent parameters for the
!   local machine environment.  It is a function subprogram with one
!   (input) argument, and can be referenced as follows:
!
!        A = D1MACH(I)
!
!   where I=1,...,5.  The (output) value of A above is determined by
!   the (input) value of I.  The results for various values of I are
!   discussed below.
!

c$$$C***PURPOSE  Returns integer machine dependent constants
c$$$C***DESCRIPTION
c$$$C
c$$$C     This is the CMLIB version of I1MACH, the integer machine
c$$$C     constants subroutine originally developed for the PORT library.
c$$$C
c$$$C     I1MACH can be used to obtain machine-dependent parameters
c$$$C     for the local machine environment.  It is a function
c$$$C     subroutine with one (input) argument, and can be called
c$$$C     as follows, for example
c$$$C
c$$$C          K = I1MACH(I)
c$$$C
c$$$C     where I=1,...,16.  The (output) value of K above is
c$$$C     determined by the (input) value of I.  The results for
c$$$C     various values of I are discussed below.
c$$$C
c$$$C  I/O unit numbers.
c$$$C    I1MACH( 1) = the standard input unit.
c$$$C    I1MACH( 2) = the standard output unit.
c$$$C    I1MACH( 3) = the standard punch unit.
c$$$C    I1MACH( 4) = the standard error message unit.
c$$$C
c$$$C  Words.
c$$$C    I1MACH( 5) = the number of bits per integer storage unit.
c$$$C    I1MACH( 6) = the number of characters per integer storage unit.
c$$$C
c$$$C  Integers.
c$$$C    assume integers are represented in the S-digit, base-A form
c$$$C
c$$$C               sign ( X(S-1)*A**(S-1) + ... + X(1)*A + X(0) )
c$$$C
c$$$C               where 0 .LE. X(I) .LT. A for I=0,...,S-1.
c$$$C    I1MACH( 7) = A, the base.
c$$$C    I1MACH( 8) = S, the number of base-A digits.
c$$$C    I1MACH( 9) = A**S - 1, the largest magnitude.
c$$$C
c$$$C  Floating-Point Numbers.
c$$$C    Assume floating-point numbers are represented in the T-digit,
c$$$C    base-B form
c$$$C               sign (B**E)*( (X(1)/B) + ... + (X(T)/B**T) )
c$$$C
c$$$C               where 0 .LE. X(I) .LT. B for I=1,...,T,
c$$$C               0 .LT. X(1), and EMIN .LE. E .LE. EMAX.
c$$$C    I1MACH(10) = B, the base.
c$$$C
c$$$C  Single-Precision
c$$$C    I1MACH(11) = T, the number of base-B digits.
c$$$C    I1MACH(12) = EMIN, the smallest exponent E.
c$$$C    I1MACH(13) = EMAX, the largest exponent E.
c$$$C
c$$$C  Double-Precision
c$$$C    I1MACH(14) = T, the number of base-B digits.
c$$$C    I1MACH(15) = EMIN, the smallest exponent E.
c$$$C    I1MACH(16) = EMAX, the largest exponent E.
c$$$C
c$$$C  To alter this function for a particular environment,
c$$$C  the desired set of DATA statements should be activated by
c$$$C  removing the C from column 1.  Also, the values of
c$$$C  I1MACH(1) - I1MACH(4) should be checked for consistency
c$$$C  with the local operating system.
